  MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-
  oriented  data store that's easy to deploy, manage and use. It's
  network accessible, written in C++ and offers the following features:

  - Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-style data
  - Full index support, including on inner objects
  - Query profiling
  - Replication and fail-over support
  - Efficient storage of binary data including large
    objects (e.g. videos)
  - Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (Q209)
    High performance, scalability, and reasonable depth of functionality
    are the goals for the project.
